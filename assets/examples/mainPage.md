## Introduction

jQuery is an open source JavaScript library that is used to simplify JavaScript development and allows you to add interactivity to a website without having knowledge of the language. It is also used as a tool to improve compatibility between browsers, since it abstracts functionality without having to worry about adaptations.
As its slogan indicates, the objective is that you write only what is necessary (i.e. the minimum) and get “more”.
